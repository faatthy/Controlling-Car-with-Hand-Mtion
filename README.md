# Controlling-Car-with-Hand-Mtion
• This project aims to control a car direction and speed using hand  motion or finger motion:

# System Description 
❑ Hand Module must fast responsive detect the posture of 
fingers.    
❑ Then, the controller of hand must send the updating of finger 
posture.    
❑ According to the finger posture, the car will move.   
❑ Thumb posture controls the speed of motors.    
# Specifications –Flexible Sensor, BT module
1. They are used to detect any motion of fingers, every finger must 
has an individually one.
2. According to the position of pack of fingers, the relative motion of 
motors will be sent to the module of car.
# Specifications –L293D, BT module, LCD
1. BT module after receiving the fingers’ posture, L293D must activate 
the motor direction.
2. LCD displays the current direction that car immediately move.
